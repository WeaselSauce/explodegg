Repo contains a few misc static assets as well as scripts that I used to power my automated wipe and forced wipe detection system.  These are no longer in use by my platform as I have moved away from a persistent LXC container setup (where the containers were stateful like a VM or bare metal server) to a new Docker based ephemeral container platform.  I'm also no longer implementing forced-wipe specific mechanics like I used to (e.g. Loadout, RP and Backpack wipes at forced wipe) so I no longer need the forced wipe components.
